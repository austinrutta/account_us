Account US Module
#################

The account_us module adds a chart of accounts that is based on a hybrid of
United States GAAP and IFRS financial accounting standards, so hopefully this
could be used as a starting point for accounting with either approach.

- Expenses (5) are grouped functionally not structurally, so think of the type
  of expense not the structure of your organization. Add the structure through
  the account name, for example, telephone expenseâ€”sales.
